# Daily LeetCode Challenges 🚀

Welcome to **Daily LeetCode Challenges**! This repository serves as a daily log of my journey through solving various algorithmic problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, practice data structures and algorithms, and ultimately prepare for technical interviews.

## 🌟 Motivation

Consistent problem-solving is key to mastering coding interviews and developing a deeper understanding of computer science. By tackling a problem each day, I'm challenging myself to think critically, optimize solutions, and learn new techniques along the way.

## 📝 What to Expect

- **Daily Problem Solutions:** A collection of problems with my detailed solutions.
- **Languages Used:** Mostly Java, but I may explore other languages like Go, JavaScript or 
  TypeScript 
  as well.

## 🚀 Why LeetCode?

LeetCode offers a diverse set of problems covering a wide range of topics such as:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- and much more!

By regularly practicing on LeetCode, I'm continuously expanding my coding toolkit and gaining the skills necessary to ace technical interviews.

## 🌱 Learning Progress

Follow along as I tackle problems from Easy to Hard difficulty levels. My journey includes:
- Exploring different approaches to the same problem.
- Optimizing solutions after initial implementation.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve at least one problem every day.
- Understand the underlying concepts and explain them through detailed solutions.
- Stay consistent and keep improving.
